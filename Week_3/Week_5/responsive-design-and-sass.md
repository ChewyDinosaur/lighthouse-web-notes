# Responsive Design and SASS

Today was a lot about the philosophy and the best practices behind two big topics, Responsive Design and *Sass.

## Responsive Design

Here is [the article that started it all](https://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design) by Ethan Marcotte. I would give this a thorough read. Even if you don't understand 100% of the CSS inside, it's fascinating to see how he breaks down the approach to it.

### Techniques

* The responsive [meta tag](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/html/responsive-meta-tag/)
* Setting the right [widths](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/w/width/)
* Using the right [units](https://css-tricks.com/confused-rem-em/)
* Learning about new [units](https://css-tricks.com/the-trick-to-viewport-units-on-mobile/)
* Last, but certainly not least, [media queries](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/media-queries-for-standard-devices/)
## Sass

Sass is a preprocessor, meaning that this is a tool that is used to build your CSS before you ever link it into an HTML document.

Here is the [home page](http://sass-lang.com/guide) for Sass. Things we looked at:

* Variables
* Nesting
* Mixins/Inheritance (@includes and @extends)
* Operators
* Partials and @import
