# Knex

Knex, the query builder library that gives you tons of cool tools for working with your database inside your JavaScript app.

We looked at:

* Configuring knex using a knexfile from knex init
* Installing knex globally so we have access to the CLI tools
* How the queries work
* Using .asCallback() as the way to get access to the results of the query, using a standard error-first Node callback pattern
* Re-using our queryHandler from this morning's lecture by only changing one property
* How migrations work, what they are, how we use them, what the value is
